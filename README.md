# testing-random-NBA-player 

A modified example from the Building Microservices coursera course: "Building a Random Fruit Web App with Python"

First, run 'make all' in the terminal. As long as all is successful,
then run 'python app.py'. This will ask to open a web browser to show the example web browser function from the app.py.

It is simple and only shows a random NBA player's name each time you click to reload the web browser.
There is a limited list of NBA player names stored, so it does not show all possible names currently.
